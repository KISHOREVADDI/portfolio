# Assets Folder

## IMPORTANT: Add Your Resume PDF Here

**The current `resume.pdf` file is EMPTY (0 bytes).**

### Steps to Fix:

1. **Delete the empty file**: Delete `src/assets/resume.pdf` (the current empty file)

2. **Add your actual resume PDF**:
   - Get your resume PDF file from your computer
   - Copy it to this folder: `src/assets/`
   - Rename it to exactly: `resume.pdf`
   - Make sure it's a valid PDF file (not empty, not corrupted)

3. **Verify the file**:
   - Right-click the file → Properties
   - Check that file size is > 0 bytes (should be several KB or MB)
   - Make sure it's a PDF file (extension should be .pdf)

4. **Restart Angular Dev Server**:
   ```bash
   # Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
   npm start
   ```

5. **Test**: Try downloading/viewing the resume again

## File Requirements

- ✅ Location: `src/assets/resume.pdf`
- ✅ File size: Must be > 0 bytes
- ✅ File type: Valid PDF file

## Current Status
