# Assets Folder

Place your resume PDF file here with the name `resume.pdf`

The file should be named exactly: `resume.pdf`

## Troubleshooting

If the PDF doesn't load or download:

1. **Restart Angular Dev Server**: After placing the file, restart your dev server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Check File Path**: The file should be at: `src/assets/resume.pdf`

3. **Verify File**: Make sure the PDF file is not corrupted and is a valid PDF

4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Clear your browser cache and try again

5. **Check Console**: Open browser developer tools (F12) and check for any errors

## File Location
- ✅ Correct: `src/assets/resume.pdf`
- ❌ Wrong: `assets/resume.pdf` (without src/)
- ❌ Wrong: `src/resume.pdf` (not in assets folder)
